                <p>Hello! I'm <span>Rupert</span>, a software developer from London but now based in Zurich, Switzerland.<br/></p>
                <p>I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether that be websites, applications, or anything in between. My goal is to always build products that provide pixel-perfect, performant experiences.<br/></p>
                <p>Following a career in retail buying I began self learning code. After two years I decided to formalise my training at Europeâ€™s toughest coding school <span>Codeworks.</span><br/></p>
                <p>Below are a few projects that I created with other team members while on the course. <br/></p>
